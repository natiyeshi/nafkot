    step 1
      - Eye redness
      - Irritation and itching of the eyes
      - Discharge from the eyes
      - Swelling of the inner surface of the eyelids  
      - Formation of small, raised bumps called follicles on the inner surface of the upper eyelid
    
    Stage 2: Intense Inflammatory Stage
      - Increased eye redness and irritation
      - Swelling of the inner surface of the eyelids
      - Thick discharge from the eyes
      - Formation of larger and more inflamed follicles
      - Pseudomembrane formation: A grayish-white membrane may develop on the inner surface of the eyelids, causing sticking of the eyelids together upon awakening.
    
    Stage 3: Scarring Stage
      - Scarring of the conjunctiva (the thin, transparent tissue covering the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids)
      - Distortion or roughening of the inner surface of the eyelids
      - Inward turning of the eyelashes (trichiasis), which causes the eyelashes to rub against the cornea
      - Eyelid deformities and eyelid margin abnormalities
